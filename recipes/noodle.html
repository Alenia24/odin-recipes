      thick slices. Discard the cooking liquid.

      In a wok or large pan over medium-high heat, pour in the vegetable
      oil and add the remaining 3 scallions, 3 ginger slices, the garlic,
      red chiles, remaining 3 star anise pods, the onion, rock sugar, and 
      spicy bean paste. Cook until the onions start to become translucent.
